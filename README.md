## Development

### Installation

  cd ~/path/to/go/github.com/carlos-loya/
  git clone https://github.com/carlos-loya/hunt-dex.git

### Feature Branching
To ensure the master repository is as stable as can be, don't make changes directly in the master branch. Instead create a new feature branch
that you can merge into the master branch through a Pull Request.

To create a new branch:

  git checkout -b cool-new-feature-branch
